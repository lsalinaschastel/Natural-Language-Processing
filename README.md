## How to run the code
The code has been developed in a jupyter-notebook and it has been uploaded in the file NLP_LuciaSalinas.ipynb. To run it, the repository should be cloned and all the requirements.txt should be installed with the command pip install -r requirements.txt. 
And execute the notebook.
