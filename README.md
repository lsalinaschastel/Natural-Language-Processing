Deliverable - UPM. 

A classification problem is addressed. The dataset contains cases from the Supreme Court of the USA. The goal is to predict which party wins the case. It has been obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/deepcontractor/supreme-court-judgment-prediction/code)

## How to run the code
The code has been developed in a Jupyter Notebook. It is uploaded in the file NLP_LuciaSalinas.ipynb. To run it, the repository should be cloned and all the requirements.txt should be installed using the command pip install -r requirements.txt, and execute the notebook. 
Without the need of downloading the code, the file can also be accessed to see the results obtained as it is already executed.
